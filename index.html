            <h2>Gran Turismo</h2>
            <p> The true story of a team of unlikely underdogs -- a working-class gamer, a former race-car driver, and an idealistic motorsport executive.
                Who risk it all to take on the most elite sport in the world.</p>
            <p>I really expected this movie to be very mediocre, but to my surprise it was very good. The movie is about a simulation gamer named 
                Jann Mardenborough who got the chance
                to compete in real life racing. All the challenges he had to face to get to where he is today was very inspiring. 
                This movie was based on a true story,
                unfortunately while racing he had a major accident and a spectator died. 
                Even though he was going through major distress after that accident he pushed through
                his emotions to gain a spot on the podium at 3rd place with his team at Le Mans; 
                the biggest 24 hour race in the world. The movie made me go through many emotions and you can really feel 
                all the feelings experienced throughout his journey.
